# Conclusion
Most of the apps are free so developers should focus on creating free apps to have a huge customer base. If developing paid apps then apps size should not be greater than 40mb. More Apps should be in the category like Events,Beauty,Parenting as they have not been explored much but still quite popular with huge installations. In order to retain the customer base apps should be updated regularly Developers should develop apps such that their content is available for everyone. Bulky apps should be developed in the category like Game, Family. If developing paid apps then its price should not be high and size should be less than 20mb. Apps belonging to Game and Family Category have high negative reviews therefore they should be developed carefully. Like this there can be a lot of conclusions but we have tried to cover the most important ones. These are some of the aspects that the developer should research before proceeding with the app development. By conducting a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the play store dataset, we not only eliminate avoidable risks of failure, but we may also be able to provide better ideas for building the app.<br>
